# Architectural Decision Record: Avenue Company Operations

## Context
The Avenue Company is engaged in various operational and research initiatives. Key components of our strategy involve the integration of data management systems and the advancement of intellectual property (IP) strategies aligned with our manufacturing and research objectives. This documentation outlines the recent decision regarding data synchronization and the research activities being pursued to enhance operational efficacy.

## Decision
As of [[Sep 30th, 2024]], the synchronization of data to ClickHouse has been successfully completed. This is a part of our ongoing operational tasks to ensure that our data management system is robust, efficient, and provides real-time insights. 

Additionally, research initiatives such as the development of:
- [[IP Strategy]]
- [[IP Documentation]]
- [[GWN spatio-temporal graph neural network with online learning architecture]]
- [[Graph-Wavenet]]

These developments will be instrumental in refining our data collection and utilization methods. We also anticipate the effects of our ongoing research in areas such as [[Avenue Footstep Sensor Research]] and [[Avenue Insights Research]].

## Consequences
The successful completion of data synchronization to ClickHouse:
- Facilitates enhanced data analysis and querying capabilities.
- Provides ground for ongoing research to gather insights into footstep sensing technology and related analytical methods.
- Strengthens the foundation for future scalability and integration of new data sources.

In terms of research, the focus on integrating ClickHouse evaluation within our systems may lead to improved operational metrics and decision-making frameworks. Immediate actions required include identifying issues related to long-term integration across various timeframes.

The tasks related to maintaining an organized approach to operational activities have been streamlined, achieving an "inbox zero" status for outstanding tasks.
