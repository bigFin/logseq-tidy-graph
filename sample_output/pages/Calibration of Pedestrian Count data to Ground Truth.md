# Architecture Decision Record for Eco-Counter Data Analysis

## Context
This Architectural Decision Record (ADR) outlines the strategy for utilizing eco-counter data collected in 2021-2022 from Victoria. The primary focus is on researching implementations that enhance the accuracy and reliability of data through calibration and trend management techniques. Improving the handling of anomalous trends is crucial to ensuring the integrity of data analysis and subsequent decision-making processes.

## Decision
To implement a structured approach to analyze the eco-counter data by taking the following actions:
1. Utilize calibration sources as predictive targets.
2. Conduct comprehensive research into methods for managing anomalous trends within the source data.
3. Develop automation strategies for the omission of anomalous data while considering the possibility of hand labeling for enhanced accuracy.

## Consequences
This decision will lead to:
- Enhanced data quality by systematically addressing anomalies and ensuring accurate predictive modeling.
- The need for additional resources and time dedicated to the research and implementation of anomaly detection algorithms.
- Potential trade-offs related to the complexity of data management, particularly in automating the anomaly identification and omission processes.
- A clearer understanding of the characteristics of anomalies, which may support future data calibration efforts.

Additional considerations include the establishment of guidelines regarding what constitutes anomalous data and how it will be documented or labeled for future reference.
