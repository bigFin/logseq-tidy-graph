# Architectural Decision Record: Avenue Company Operations and Research Integration

## Context
The Avenue Company is implementing significant enhancements within its operations and research functions. This involves updating data handling processes, specifically to ensure synchronization with Clickhouse, as well as exploring advanced analytical frameworks such as graph-based neural networks.

This decision is primarily influenced by the need to gather insights from extensive datasets, including those derived from the [[Avenue Footstep Sensor]] and [[Avenue Insights Research]]. The integration of different technologies is aimed at improving the efficacy of data analysis and deploying predictive models.

## Decision
To optimize data operations at Avenue Company, the following actions have been prioritized:

1. **Synchronization with Clickhouse**: Complete the data synchronization task with Clickhouse, which has been successfully executed as of September 30, 2024. 
   - Status: DONE
   - Completion Date: [[Sep 30th, 2024]]
   
2. **Research Initiatives**:
   - This includes ongoing explorations into the following areas:
     - **Intellectual Property Strategy** and related documentation on IP.
     - The integration of [[GWN spatio-temporal graph neural network with online learning architecture]] and [[Graph-Wavenet]] into research methodologies.
     - Further development under [[Avenue Footstep Sensor Research]] and [[Avenue Insights Research]], with a current focus on staging and integrating Clickhouse evaluation. 

3. **Case Studies**: For comprehensive evaluation and decision-making, case studies will be developed and incorporated into the research workflow.

4. **Task Management**: An initiative labeled "Inbox zero" has been launched to streamline task management, ensuring all existing tasks are addressed efficiently.

## Consequences
The successful synchronization with Clickhouse has enabled enhanced data retrieval capabilities, facilitating more accurate analyses related to pedestrian counts and overall foot traffic. 

The exploration of [[IP Strategy]] and graph-based models prepares Avenue Company for potential enhancements in predictive analytics and machine learning applications. Furthermore, formalizing case studies will contribute valuable insights that can be leveraged for future initiatives.

While these steps promise increased operational efficiency and deeper insights, they require continuous evaluation to address potential issues such as the integration challenges that may arise when using complex databases and machine learning models. As highlighted, concerns about integration failures over time need to be systematized and monitored.
